# ImageSegmentationMasterThesisJADS2019_2020Final
In this repository, the code that was used in the conduct of my research about the effects of preprocessing on segmentation model performance is stored. For running the experiments we made use of a framework that was developed by the Biomedical Imaging Group (BIGR) that is part of the Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam. The original code for this framework can be found at: https://github.com/karinvangarderen/glassimaging. As the original code is released under the apache license 2.0, we are obliged to notify you of the changes that have been made to the original. Changes made include the addition of extra data loaders for the Lipo dataset, the Ergonomics dataset and the LiTS dataset. Furthermore, the niftidataset file has been modified to include additional preprocessing steps such as configuration dependant z-scoring or robust min-max normalization, Otsu thresholding, N4 bias correction, and the option to use a resampling factor of 1, 2, or 4. In addition to this, scripts are included that were used for testing purposes, visualisation and scripts for running code on the GPU and CPU cluster
